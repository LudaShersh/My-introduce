# MyIntroduce
## Hello. My name is Liudmila. I graduated from belarusian state university of transport as a engineer. 
## Than I stated to work on belarusian railway. I was in charge of checking transport documents. If documents have any mistake I have to fix or if I don't have power I have to decided who fix. I really liked my job. But myjob had big problem - I quiet often worked at night. I had day shifts and night shifts. So I decided to looking for new job. I found QA because it's the similarmy last job. Now I'm studying on QA courses by Vadim Ksendzove.
## Also I can say that I'm an easy-going person. As for me  I don't have problems to communicate with people. Also I'm an attentive person. As I said before I worked at night and any mistakes cost very expensive.
